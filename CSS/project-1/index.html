        Student leadership enhancement involves giving students opportunities to practice leadership skills in a supportive learning environment. It is contended that leadership can be systematically developed so that students are more proficient in: project planning; reflection; problem solving; team building; decision making; goal setting; time management; project management and resource allocation; effective communication and networking; conflict resolution; diversity awareness; and self-confidence. These 12 skills are also linked to the four academic enabling skills of: interpersonal relationships; motivation; study skills; and engagement. Using this framework it is argued that student leadership can be embedded within the school curriculum. Two sample lessons illustrate this procedure, which is being introduced into a Brisbane high school. Some feedback from participating teachers is outlined.
